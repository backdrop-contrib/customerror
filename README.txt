Description
-----------
This module allows the site admin to create custom error pages for
404 (not found), and 403 (access denied).

Since the error pages are not real nodes, they do not belong a category
term, and hence will not show up in node listings.

Features
--------
* Configurable page title and descriptions.
* Any HTML formatted text can be be put in the page body.
* Handles 404 and 403 errors at present. Drupal only allows those two
  errors to be assigned custom pages. The design of this module is 
  flexible though and can accommodate future codes easily.

Database
--------
This module does not require any new database tables to be installed.

Installation:
-------------
Please see the INSTALL.txt document for details.
